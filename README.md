Just makes two to five sine wave sounds that are descending in pitch when the user clicks the "Drop Bombs" button.  Not a whole lot there right now...

It's doesn't cutoff the sounds.  To get rid of the annoying sounds close your browser tab or hit the refresh button.

Turn your volume <u>down</u> before you click the 'Drop some "Bombs"' button.
