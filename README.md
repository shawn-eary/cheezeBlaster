Just makes two to five sine wave sounds that are descending in pitch when the user clicks the "Start the Goofy 'Program'" button.  Not a whole lot there right now...

Turn your volume <u>down</u> before you click the "Start the Goofy 'Program'" button.

Hope to add graphics soon when I get a change to get there.
