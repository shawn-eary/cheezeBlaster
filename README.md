This is seriously messed up right now...

All it does is make goofy accidental weird sounds when you click 'Drop some "Bombs"'.  It's supposed to run locally in a Firefox or Chromium based browser.  Supposed to be game someday, but I have a very short attention span...

It's doesn't cutoff the sounds.  To get rid of the annoying sounds close your browser tab or hit the refresh button.

Turn your volume <u>down</u> before you click the 'Drop some "Bombs"' button.
