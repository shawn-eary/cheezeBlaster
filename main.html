    Make sure you turn your volume down before you click
    "Drop some 'Bombs'".  You may find the generated tones
    "annoying"...
    </p>
    <p>
    If the code freaks out and you can't stand the
    sound, close the tab/browser or hit the refresh button
    which used to be also connected to F5.

    This is supposed to be a game someday, but I'm easily
    distracted.  This code is best run on your local PC
    right now, but it will very likely be put into my
    personal website some day.

    You don't need Visual Studio to make this work.  Just
    Notepad and a decent internet browser like Chrome, FireFox
    or Microsoft's Chromium based Edge.  I don't know if this works
    on old school Edge or not.  Forget traying Internet Explorer.
    Internet Explorer does not support the Web Audio API<br />
